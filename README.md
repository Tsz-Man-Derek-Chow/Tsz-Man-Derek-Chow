# Welcome to Tsz Man Derek Chow's Portfolio
## About
I am an M.S. in Applied Analytics student from Columbia University who strives to solve the worldâ€™s business problems with evidence-based solutions. I translate raw information into meaningful and comprehensible insights with my knowledge in the technical aspects of data analytics and its application in business operations. I transform insights into actionable strategies with my ability to understand the context of business problems and my ability to think critically to compose the most suitable solutions.

This a repository to showcase the projects, certifications, and courses that I have completed.
